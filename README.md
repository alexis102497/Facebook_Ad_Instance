# Facebook_Ad_Instance

Project Summary 

In this project, I analyzed a digital marketing campaign dataset to evaluate the performance of different age groupd in terms of click-through-rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and cost per acquisation (CPA). Using Excel Pivot Table Using Excel PivotTables and custom formulas, I calculated and visualized KPIs to identify the most and least cost-effective target segments. The analysis revealed that users aged 40–44 had the lowest CPA and CPC, indicating a more efficient conversion process, while ages 45–49, despite having the highest CTR, showed the highest CPA, suggesting higher engagement but also higher acquisition cost. These insights inform future ad budget allocation and audience targeting strategies.
